# paintprogram
A simple paint program written in python 
This is a practice for python kivy. In this project I will create a simple paint program for android devices. I will be using a tutorial for this little project of mine. The goal is to be able to create other android applications. This is not my first kivy project so I have some goals I would like to achieve with this one. 
Libraries used:
-Kivy(needs to be installed)
Also used buildozer to compile .py into .apk.
